# Neural Collapse Example

The notebook `neuralcollapse.ipynb` contains code demonstrating Neural Collapse 
on Cross-Entropy and MSE Loss.
Notebook is designed to be short, easy-to-interpret, and executable
from the browser using Google Colab. (There is a link in the notebook to open in Colab.)

MNIST-ResNet18 was chosen because it ran most reliably within the in-browser
the memory constraints of Google Colab.
If you are *still* getting out-of-memory errors, try clicking
"Runtime"->"Factory Reset Runtime" on the Colab menu bar.

It should be clear how to adapt code to other networks-dataset combinations
to be run on local clusters with more memory, but if you run into trouble,
please feel free to contact the authors. We'd be glad to help.
Happy experimenting!
